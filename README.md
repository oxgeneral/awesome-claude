- **Computer Use (GA)** — Claude controls GUI applications via screenshot + action loop. Now generally available with sub-second action latency improvements.
- **1M Token Context** — Opus 4 supports 1M tokens for processing entire codebases, books, or long document collections in a single request.
- **Prompt Caching** — Cache system prompts up to 90% cost reduction on repeated large-context calls. Cache TTL is 5 minutes (Ephemeral) or 1 hour (Persistent).
- **Batch API** — Process up to 100k prompts asynchronously with 50% cost reduction. Results delivered within 24 hours.
- **Streaming Tool Use** — Stream tool call deltas in real time, enabling live UX during agentic task execution.
- **Video Understanding** — Opus 4 can process video frames for temporal reasoning, UI walkthroughs, and video QA (beta).
- **Citations API** — Claude can return structured source attribution from documents, grounding responses in specific passages.

### Quickstart

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20260101",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain extended thinking in Claude 4."}
    ]
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```

**With Extended Thinking:**

```python
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-20260101",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000  # Claude reasons internally before answering
    },
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Solve this step by step..."}]

## Prompt Engineering

> Techniques, libraries, and reference resources for getting the best results from Claude.

### Core Techniques

- **[Anthropic Prompt Engineering Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview)** — Official comprehensive guide. Start here.
- **[Prompt Library](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/prompt-library)** — Anthropic's curated collection of production-ready prompts across dozens of use cases.

### Prompting Tips for Claude 4

```
# Use XML tags for structured inputs
<document>{{content}}</document>
<task>Summarize the key findings and list action items.</task>

# Chain of thought — ask Claude to reason before answering
Think through this step by step before giving your final answer.

# Specify the output format explicitly
Respond in JSON with keys: summary, confidence (0-1), sources (list).

# For extended thinking — let Claude allocate its own reasoning budget
This is a complex problem. Use your full reasoning capacity before answering.

# Prefilling — start the assistant turn to constrain output format
Human: Extract the JSON...
Assistant: ```json
{
```

### Recommended Prompts

**System prompt for a coding assistant:**
```
You are an expert software engineer. When writing code:
- Default to modern, idiomatic patterns for the language
- Include error handling unless told otherwise
- Explain non-obvious decisions in brief inline comments
- Ask clarifying questions before making large architectural changes
```

**System prompt for document analysis:**
```
You are a precise document analyst. Extract only information explicitly present 
in the provided documents. If something is unclear or absent, say so directly. 
Do not infer or speculate beyond what is written. Format your output as requested.
```

**Meta-prompt for evaluating responses:**
```
Review your previous response for:
1. Factual accuracy — flag any uncertain claims
2. Completeness — did you miss anything important?
3. Conciseness — remove anything that doesn't add value
Provide a revised version if improvements are needed.
```

## Agentic Patterns

> Architectures and patterns for building reliable multi-step Claude agents.

### Patterns

**ReAct (Reason + Act)**
```python
# Claude reasons about what tool to use, uses it, observes the result, repeats
while not done:
    thought = claude.think(context)
    action = claude.decide_action(thought, available_tools)
    observation = execute_tool(action)
    context.add(thought, action, observation)
```

**Orchestrator–Subagent**
```
Orchestrator Claude (Opus 4)
├── Plans the overall task, delegates subtasks
├── Subagent: Research Claude (Sonnet 4) — web retrieval
├── Subagent: Code Claude (Sonnet 4) — implementation
└── Subagent: Review Claude (Sonnet 4) — validation
```

**Prompt Chaining with Validation**
```python
# Break complex tasks into verifiable sequential steps
step1 = claude.complete("Extract all requirements from this spec", doc)
validated = validate_extraction(step1)
step2 = claude.complete("Write tests for each requirement", validated)
step3 = claude.complete("Implement code to pass these tests", step2)
```

**Parallel Specialization**
```python
import asyncio

async def parallel_analysis(document):
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        claude.analyze(document, role="security expert"),
        claude.analyze(document, role="performance engineer"),
        claude.analyze(document, role="UX designer")
    )
    return claude.synthesize(results)
```
